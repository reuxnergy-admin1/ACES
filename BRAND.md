# ACES Aerodynamics — Brand Marks and Clearance

## Overview

This document codifies logo usage until a full brand guide is produced. It focuses on exclusion zones (clearance), minimum size, contrast requirements, and misuse examples.

## Primary Mark

Use the provided ACES wordmark. Until final vectors are delivered, use `/public/aces-logo.svg` as a placeholder.

## Clearance (Exclusion Area)

- **Minimum clearance** equals the cap height of the letter "A" in the wordmark (denoted as X)
- Maintain at least X spacing on all sides: top, bottom, left, right
- In product UI (tight spaces), the absolute minimum is 0.5×X, but avoid when possible

## Minimum Size

- **Digital**: Do not render the wordmark below 64px width or 16px cap height
- **Print**: Do not render the wordmark below 20mm width

## Backgrounds and Contrast

- Use the white mark on dark backgrounds; black mark on light backgrounds
- For imagery, place on solid colour panels (8–12% opacity) or blur panels
- Avoid placing over high-frequency detail
- Maintain ≥4.5:1 contrast ratio around the mark

## Lockups

- Lockups (logo + descriptor) should maintain ≥0.5×X spacing between elements
- Centre vertically when paired with navigation elements

## Misuse Guidelines (Do Not)

- Do not stretch, skew, rotate, add drop shadows, outlines, glows, or gradients to the mark
- Do not change letter spacing or re-typeset the wordmark
- Do not place on low-contrast or noisy backgrounds without a surface panel

## Header Usage

- In navigation, preserve a minimum 8px inner padding around the SVG canvas
- Maintain ≥X outer clearance from other menu items
- Click/tap target should be ≥44px height for accessibility compliance

## File Preparation

- Provide the logo as SVG with a tight viewBox and no embedded raster images
- Export a monochrome variant (black/white) and an outline variant for special use cases
