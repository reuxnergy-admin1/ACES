ACES Aerodynamics — Brand Marks and Clearspace

Overview
- This document codifies logo usage until a full brand book is produced. It focuses on exclusion (clearspace), minimum size, contrast, and misuse examples.

Primary Mark
- Use the provided ACES wordmark. Until final vectors ship, use `/public/aces-logo.svg` as a placeholder.

Clearspace (Exclusion Area)
- Minimum clearspace equals the cap height of the letter “A” in the wordmark (denoted as X).
- Maintain at least X spacing on all sides: top, bottom, left, right.
- In product UI (tight spaces), the absolute minimum is 0.5×X, but avoid when possible.

Minimum Size
- Digital: do not render the wordmark below 64px width or 16px cap height.
- Print: do not render the wordmark below 20mm width.

Backgrounds and Contrast
- Use the white mark on dark backgrounds; black mark on light. For imagery, place on solid color chips (8–12% opacity) or blur panels.
- Avoid placing over high-frequency detail. Maintain ≥ 4.5:1 contrast ratio around the mark.

Lockups
- Lockups (logo + descriptor) should keep ≥ 0.5×X spacing between elements. Center vertically when paired with navigation.

Misuse (Do Not)
- Do not stretch, skew, rotate, add drop shadows, outlines, glows, or gradients to the mark.
- Do not change letter spacing or re-typeset the wordmark.
- Do not place on low-contrast or noisy backgrounds without a surface chip.

Header Usage
- In navigation, preserve a minimum 8px inner padding around the SVG canvas and ≥ X outer clearspace from other menu items.
- Click/tap target should be ≥ 44px height.

File Prep
- Provide the logo as SVG with a tight viewBox and no embedded raster images.
- Export a monochrome variant (black/white) and an outline variant for special use.
