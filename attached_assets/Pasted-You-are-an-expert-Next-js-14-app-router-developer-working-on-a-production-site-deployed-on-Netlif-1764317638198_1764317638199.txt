You are an expert Next.js 14+ (app router) developer working on a production site deployed on Netlify.
The site currently has serious Lighthouse problems (extremely high TBT 86s+, blocked fonts.googleapis.com due to CSP, unsafe CSP directives, flashing text during webfont load, huge unused JavaScript).

Fix ALL of the following issues while keeping 100% of the current layout, styling, content, and visual design exactly the same on both mobile and desktop. Do NOT remove any page, section, component, or feature.

Specific tasks (in order of priority):

1. Fix Content Security Policy (CSP) – implement a strong, modern CSP via next.js headers (next.config.js or middleware) that:
   - Removes all 'unsafe-inline', 'unsafe-eval', data:, http:, https: from script-src
   - Uses nonce-based approach for all inline scripts (including those generated by Next.js)
   - Uses 'strict-dynamic' + 'self' + specific hashes/nonces where needed
   - Allows necessary third-party domains:
     • fonts.googleapis.com (for Open Sans)
     • fonts.gstatic.com (for Open Sans)
     • use.typekit.net and p.typekit.net (already used)
     • simpleanalyticscdn.com (for /latest.js)
     • Any other domains currently required (check _document.js or layout.tsx)
   - Properly separates style-src, style-src-elem, script-src, script-src-elem, img-src, connect-src, font-src
   - Add report-uri or report-to if possible

2. Fix Google Fonts blocking and FOIT (flash of invisible text):
   - Preconnect and dns-prefetch to fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com
   - Self-host Open Sans locally (download woff2 files for all weights/italics used) OR
     If keeping Google Fonts, use <link rel="preload"> + font-display: swap in the @font-face that Google generates
   - Remove the three console errors about fonts.googleapis.com being blocked

3. Dramatically reduce Total Blocking Time (currently 86 seconds!) and main-thread work:
   - Dynamically import heavy chunks only when needed (especially the chunk …/108.4ef45906ec7a6663.js which takes 172 seconds of CPU)
   - Use React.lazy + Suspense wherever possible for non-critical sections
   - Add loading fallback UI that matches current design (so no visual change)
   - Defer all non-critical third-party scripts (Simple Analytics, etc.) using next/script strategy="afterInteractive" or "lazyOnload"

4. Reduce unused JavaScript:
   - Analyze the huge chunks (cd2bc502…, 40f94348…, 108.…), find what library/component is causing them and either:
     • Tree-shake / dynamically import it
     • Replace with lighter alternative if possible without changing visuals
   - Ensure all page-level components that are not needed above the fold are lazy-loaded

5. Ensure text remains visible during webfont load:
   - Add font-display: swap to Open Sans (either via self-hosted @font-face or via Google Fonts ?display=swap parameter)

6. Fix Time to Interactive (currently 148 seconds):
   - All the above fixes combined should bring TBT under 300 ms and TTI under 5–6 s on slow 4G/mobile

7. Minor best-practice fixes:
   - Add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /> if missing
   - Ensure all images have width/height or aspect-ratio to prevent CLS (but CLS is already 0.003 so probably fine)

Deliverables:
- Updated next.config.js (or middleware.ts) with proper CSP headers + nonce generation
- Updated root layout.tsx (app/layout.tsx) with proper preconnect, preload, font-display: swap
- Code changes to lazy-load the heaviest components (add React.lazy/Suspense with matching fallback skeletons)
- If self-hosting fonts: a new /public/fonts folder with woff2 files + updated @font-face in global CSS
- next/script tags for any third-party scripts
- Keep every single heading, button, menu, image, color, spacing, alignment exactly as-is

Do NOT change or remove any existing page content, navigation, hero section, cards, forms, footer, mobile menu behavior, or visual styling.

After applying these changes, the Lighthouse mobile score should jump from 44 → 90+ and all CSP and console errors must disappear.

Start by showing me the exact code changes you would make (especially next.config.js headers/middleware, layout.tsx font handling, and any lazy-loading you add).
