You are an expert Next.js 14+ (app router) developer.  
The site was just optimized for Lighthouse (CSP fixed, fonts self-hosted/preloaded, heavy chunks lazy-loaded, nonce-based script-src, etc.), but now some content and visual effects are completely missing or broken:
- Hero section text / headings disappeared
- Some images no longer load
- Animations / fade-ins / scroll effects are gone
- Certain sections (cards, testimonials, pricing, etc.) are blank
- Mobile menu or some buttons may have stopped working

Your ONLY job: restore 100% of the original content, text, images, and effects EXACTLY as they were before the optimization, while keeping ALL the performance and security fixes (strong CSP with nonces, lazy-loading, self-hosted fonts or preloaded Google Fonts with display=swap, deferred scripts, etc.).

Do NOT downgrade or remove any of the following improvements:
- Strong nonce-based CSP (no 'unsafe-inline', no http:/https:/data: schemes)
- Lazy-loading of heavy components with React.lazy + Suspense
- Preconnect/preload + font-display: swap for Open Sans
- next/script with strategy="afterInteractive" or "lazyOnload" for third-party scripts
- Reduced TBT, unused JS, etc.

Specific fixes required:

1. Find every place where content disappeared because of over-eager lazy-loading or Suspense fallback issues:
   - Replace any empty <div/> or blank fallback with a proper skeleton that exactly matches the original design (same heights, colors, placeholder text if needed)
   - Ensure the real component is actually rendered once loaded (check import paths, default exports, etc.)

2. Fix missing images:
   - If images are now broken because img-src in CSP is too strict → add the exact domains/hostnames that serve your images (Netlify CDN, your own domain, etc.) to img-src and default-src
   - If using next/image with remote images, ensure loader or domains are correctly configured in next.config.js

3. Restore all animations and effects:
   - If framer-motion / AOS / custom scroll animations stopped working because scripts were deferred too aggressively → move those specific animation libraries back to strategy="afterInteractive" (not lazyOnload) OR ensure their initialization runs after hydration
   - If CSS animations were stripped because of 'unsafe-inline' removal → generate and inject proper nonce for inline <style> tags used by animation libraries

4. Fix any inline styles or scripts that were accidentally blocked:
   - Identify any remaining legitimate inline <script> or <style> (e.g., from libraries, Typekit, Simple Analytics, custom cursor, etc.)
   - Add correct nonce={{nonce}} to them in layout.tsx or _document.js
   - If Typekit or other services inject inline styles, add their exact hashes to style-src (or keep 'unsafe-inline' only for style-src if absolutely necessary and no nonce possible)

5. Text/content missing because of font loading race:
   - Ensure font-display: swap is actually applied (check the final CSS URL has &display=swap or self-hosted @font-face has font-display: swap)
   - Add fallback font stack that is visually identical in size/weight (system fonts as temporary backup)

6. Hero and other critical above-the-fold content:
   - NEVER lazy-load anything in the hero section or first viewport
   - Move any hero components out of React.lazy if they were accidentally wrapped

Deliverables:
- Fully restored site: every heading, paragraph, image, button, animation, hover effect, mobile menu, and scroll-triggered effect works exactly like before
- Lighthouse mobile score still 90+ (do not reintroduce 'unsafe-inline' in script-src or plain https:/http: schemes)
- Zero console errors
- All previous optimizations remain intact

Start by showing me exactly which files/components were over-lazy-loaded or mis-configured in CSP, and provide the precise code fixes (layout.tsx, next.config.js updates, CSP header tweaks, Suspense fallbacks, etc.).
