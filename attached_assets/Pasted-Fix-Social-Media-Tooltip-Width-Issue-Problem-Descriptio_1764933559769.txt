Fix Social Media Tooltip Width Issue
Problem Description
The social media tooltip section contains 4 icons (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn) with hover tooltips. When hovering over these icons on desktop/web, a popup/tooltip appears showing the platform name, but the container width is too small, causing the text to appear cramped or truncated.
Current Behavior

Tooltips appear on hover but have insufficient width
The text block around the social media platform names (WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook) is too narrow
Manual attempts to adjust pixel width have not resolved the issue

Required Fix
Please locate and fix the tooltip width issue in the social media section of the Next.js/React/Tailwind CSS website. The fix should:

Find the tooltip component - Search for the social media tooltip/popup implementation in the codebase
Identify the width constraint - The issue could be in:

Tailwind classes (e.g., w-20, max-w-xs, etc.)
Custom CSS with fixed width
Parent container constraints
Padding/spacing issues


Implement the solution:

Increase tooltip container width to properly accommodate text
Use whitespace-nowrap if text should stay on one line
Consider using w-auto or w-fit with appropriate min-w-* values
Ensure proper padding (e.g., px-3 py-2 or px-4 py-2)
Test that longer names like "Instagram" and "LinkedIn" fit comfortably


Suggested Tailwind approach:

jsx   className="w-auto min-w-max px-3 py-2 whitespace-nowrap"
   // or
   className="w-fit px-4 py-2"

Verify the fix:

All four platform names display fully without truncation
Tooltips have balanced padding around text
Hover behavior works correctly
Responsive behavior is maintained



Files to Check

Look for files containing social media components, typically in:

/components/SocialMedia.tsx or .jsx
/components/Footer.tsx or /components/Header.tsx
/app/ or /pages/ directories
Any file with "social", "tooltip", or "share" in the name



Additional Context

Tech stack: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
Issue occurs on web/desktop view with hover interaction
Four social platforms: WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn

Please analyze the code, identify the root cause, implement the fix, and confirm the tooltips now display correctly with proper width.
